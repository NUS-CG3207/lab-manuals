# RISC-V Memory Map

### Memory Map of OUR\* RISC-V Processor

\*This memory map is not compliant with any standards/recommendations. It is just the choice/design of the CG3207 lecturer.

The data memory is further divided into constant (ROM) and variable memories (RAM).

| Address                     | Attributes      | DESCRIPTION                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

| 0x00000000 to 0x000001FC    | RO (Read Only)  | Instruction memory (ROM). 128 words. Word addressable - only multiples of 4 are valid addresses. This might cause warnings about 2 unused bits, but that's ok.                                                                                     |

| 0x00002400                  | WO (Write Only) | LED[15:8]. Only the least significant 8 bits written to this location are used. LED[7] is used to show the divided clock. LED[6:0] shows PC[8:2]. PC[1:0] will always be 0 and hence not shown.                                                    |
| 0x00002404                  | RO              | DIP switches. Only the least significant 16 bits read from this location are valid, corresponding to SW[15:0].                                                                                                                                     |

#### Table 1: Memory map summary

### Endianness

The instruction and data memory are WORD addressable (NOT byte-addressable) for our labs. => Endianness doesn't matter for our hardware. Endianness matters only when each byte in the memory has an address, but we read/write one word (4 bytes) in one go. For example, if we store two words 0xABCD1234 and 0xEF567890 in the memory starting at the address 0x00000000, the two words will be stored at word addresses 0x00000000 and 0x00000004 respectively. In a system with a little-endian processor like RISC-V, the byte address 0x00000000 will have the content 0x34, byte address 0x00000001 will have the content 0x12, byte address 0x00000003 will have the content 0xAB, byte address 0x00000004 will have the content 0x90, byte address 0x00000007 will have the content 0xEF. In CG3207 labs, we use a memory that cannot deal with byte addresses such as 0x00000001 and 0x00000002. We can only send word addresses (addresses which are multiples of 4), i.e., like 0x00000000 and 0x00000004, and get the corresponding 32-bit contents. Hence, for our hardware, endianness doesn't matter.
